## Practice example on TDD with ReactJS

This is a practice project on TDD with ReactJS

- React app displaying `Increment` and `Decrement` buttons and counter value as text.
- On clicking on `Increment` button, counter value should increment by 1.
- On clicking on `Decrement` button, counter value should decrement by 1.
- When counter value becomes 0, then `Decrement` button should be disabled and restrict user to decrement further.
- Wheb counter value increments from 0 to 1, `Decrement` button should be enabled again.
